  description: "Despite ceaseless attempts on claiming control over Royal Prussia
    by King Charles Gustaw, Gda\u0144sk stood its ground. It is famous for its fierce
    naval defensiveness proven through several battles, one of which happened in
    July of 1656. During this battle 30 Dutch and 10 Danish ships relieved valiant
    defenders of maritime blockade. It is also the place where Peace Treaty of Oliwa
    ended the Deluge."
