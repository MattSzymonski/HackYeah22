  description: "Known for being taken without fight by traitorous Krzysztof Opali\u0144ski
    with a promise of civil handling of its occupied population. Sadly, these promises
    were not held and city's suburbs were burned to the ground. In 1657 finally relieved
    by the mass mobilization after few months of morbid siege."
