  description: "A turning point in the events happening during the Deluge. Led by
    father Augustyn Kordecki, valiant defenders of Jasna G\xF3ra played a sleight
    of hand with the Swedish King to prevent the siege. When it ultimately happened,
    Polish forces were much better prepared thanks to the bought time and planning
    ahead. The occupants resorted to digging under battlements but were wiped out
    during a heroic charge led by Jan Zamoyski. When the occupants were drawn back,
    the war ceased to have a defensive character and Polish counteroffensive began."
