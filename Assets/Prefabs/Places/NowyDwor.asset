  description: After Warsaw was taken by Swedish occupants they tried crossing the
    Narew river. Polish forces exploited favorable terrain formations and kept on
    pushing back wave after wave of Swedish forces. Unfortunately, they managed to
    construct a bridge which turned the tide of the battle to their side.
