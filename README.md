# HackYeah22: The Deluge

## Intro to game

Year 1655 was not gentle for Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. After Cossak-Polish War lead by Bogdan Chmielnicki ravaged most of nowadays Ukraine and Lithuania heavily incapacitating Commonwealth prowess, yet another threat loomed over the Kingdom.

The Deluge...

One would think that after the Treaty of Stuhmsdorf the enmity between Swedish Crown and the Commonwealth would die down. Conversely, this is a story of devious political moves, treachery and immense bravery of the common folk.

It is you who aids the Commonwealth of 1655 as a simple Nobleman or a Noblewoman assembling their own army and participating in several pivotal battles of this period.
